-- MTB Trails Database Design

-- Tables

	-- table/column names in lowercase, data types in CAPITALS

		trail_difficulties
			difficulty_id		SMALLINT NOT NULL
			difficulty_color	VARCHAR(255 BYTE)
			-- primary key constraint for difficulty_id
			-- this table will not be altered by any API requests

		trails
			id						INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY
			name						VARCHAR(255 BYTE)
			zipcode						SMALLINT
			difficulty_id					SMALLINT
			largedrop					SMALLINT
			smalldrop					SMALLINT
			woodride					SMALLINT
			skinny						SMALLINT
			largejump					SMALLINT
			smalljump					SMALLINT
			gap						SMALLINT
			-- primary key constraint for id
			-- foreign key constraint for difficulty_id, referencing trail_difficulties table
			-- columns largedrop through gap would be BOOLEAN type, but Oracle SQl doesn't have this. 0/1 will be used.

-- Sequences

	trail_seq
		MINVALUE		1
		START WITH 		1
		INCREMENT BY		1
		CACHE			10
		-- used for incrementation of trail id

-- Sample Queries

	-- Add new trail difficulty
	INSERT INTO TRAIL_DIFFICULTIES(DIFFICULTY_ID, DIFFICULTY_COLOR)
	VALUES(1, "Green")

	-- Add new trail
	INSERT INTO TRAILS(ID, NAME, ZIPCODE, DIFFICULTY_ID, LARGEDROP, SMALLDROP, WOODRIDE, SKINNY, LARGEJUMP, SMALLUMP, GAP)
	VALUES(trail_seq.nextval, "No Secret", 97330, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)
